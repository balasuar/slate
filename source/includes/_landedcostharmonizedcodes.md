## Harmonized Codes

### Browse Harmonized Codes

Presents the all available Harmonized Codes as a browseable tree. Each request specifies a parent node, and the response lists all child nodes of that parent. If no parent node is specified, all root-level nodes will be returned.

#### Request
```plaintext
GET http://sandbox.landedcost.api.avalara.com/v2/browse?system=HTS&parent=HS_93
```

**system** string, optional  
The classification system you want to browse. Must be one of:

- TARIC 
- SCHEDULEB
- HTS

**parent** string, optional  
The name of the parent node. Note that it is important to use the *name* of the node, as not all nodes have a harmonized code, and the code itself is different than the name.

### Search Harmonized Codes

<aside class="alert"> This method is currently in alpha release only. As such, it may be changed without notice. Please plan accordingly. </aside>

Given an item description, returns a set of harmonized codes, and a non-normalized score that indicates how close the computer thinks this match is to the actual answer.

**source_country** string  
The two-character ISO code identifying the origin country associated with the duty.

**formula** string  
The formula used to calculate the rate, presented in Avalara-specific format.

**unit** string  
If the rate is assessed at a unit level, the appropriate unit involved. If `type` is not `units`, this value will be an empty string.

**raw** string  
The human-readable version of the rate.

**currency** string  
The three-character ISO code for the currency in which the duty should be assessed.

**required** string  
The required input values to calculate the correct duty amount.

**customs-value** string  
The customs value describes how to apply the duty rate. There are two current types

- extended-price: The rate applies to the following product: Price * Quantity
- net-price: The rate applies to the the following Sum: Price * Quantity + Shipping + Insurance

**type** string  
There are three types of landed cost rates that may be returned.

- ad valorem: this rate applies to the declared `customs-value` This is typically represented as a percentage of the cost.
- units: this is a rate that is tied to unit of measure. This is typically expressed as a monetary value per quantity, such as: $1/kg
- unknown: there is no stored rate data (or no applicable taxes) for the specified combination. Note that these will always have `"formula": "notax()"`
